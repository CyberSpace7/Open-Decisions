# Open-Decisions
A core purpose for the spokescouncil is for our groups to hear each other, to discover who agrees on what, and who disagrees. Those who agree can find each other and take action together. Those who disagree can find each other, discuss and debate, and create new solutions that take more perspectives into account, building broader agreement.
